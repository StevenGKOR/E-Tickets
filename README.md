E-Tickets is a full-stack web application developed using the C# programming language, .NET Core framework, Bootstrap, HTML, and SQL Server. The application provides a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

One of the unique features of the E-Tickets application is the ability for users to purchase movie tickets via PayPal for movies being shown in different cinemas. Users can register, login, and logout to the application to access this functionality.

In addition to this, an administrator has the ability to manage movies, which includes the ability to create, update, and delete movies. The administrator can also view all users and their purchase history. To test the delete, update, and add functionality, a pre-defined administrator account can be used to login with the credentials Email: admin@etickets.com | Password: Coding@1234?

Overall, E-Tickets is a user-friendly web application that provides a seamless movie ticket purchasing experience for users while providing easy movie management capabilities for administrators.
